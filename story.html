                When Bruce finally reveals himself as Batman to Lieutenant Gordon, he says, "A hero can be anyone — even
                <br>a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to
                let
                <br>him know that the world hadn't ended," referring to what Gordon did for him when he was younger.

                            Batman talks to Lt. James Gordon about how he's now perceived as a villain following the
                            death of
                            Harvey
                            Dent. He says, "You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the
                            villain. I can
                            do
                            those things. Because I'm not a hero, not like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I

                            Batman is forced to go into hiding when he's pinpointed as the blame for Joker's actions.

                            children in Gotham. The quote is ironic, but perfect for his character.
