                When Bruce finally reveals himself as Batman to Lieutenant Gordon, he says, "A hero can be anyone — even
                <br>a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to
                let
                <br>him know that the world hadn't ended," referring to what Gordon did for him when he was younger.
