            <h1>“A hero can be anyone.”</h1>
            <p>
                When Bruce finally reveals himself as Batman to Lieutenant Gordon, he says, "A hero can be anyone — even
                <br>a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to
                let
                <br>him know that the world hadn't ended," referring to what Gordon did for him when he was younger.

                <td>Batman's costume is made of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium. It is bullet-resistant and
                    resistant to most forms of attack, including explosions, blunt-force trauma, falls etc. It is also
                    flame-retardant and insulated. The gloves and boots of the suit are reinforced to nullify the impact
                    of punches and kicks. The gauntlets have finned metallic blades on their sides. The cape is
                    extremely light and can be used to glide long distances, it is also reinforced to be flame
                    redundant. The cowl is composed in small part of lead, which shields Batman's face from
                    identification via x-rays. It has also an infrared viewer and auditory sensors. The cowl is
                    outfitted with security systems and, like his utility belt, the mask is also a transmitter/receiver.

                    a fingerprint kit, a cutting tool, a grappling hook gun, re-breather and many other tools.</td>

                    an Australian boomerang so when it is thrown it returns to the user. It has the strength to knock
                    opponents out with blunt contact. They can also have various effects including the ability to
                    electrocute and explode.</td>
