                When Bruce finally reveals himself as Batman to Lieutenant Gordon, he says, "A hero can be anyone — even
                <br>a man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to
                let
                <br>him know that the world hadn't ended," referring to what Gordon did for him when he was younger.

                The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin story.[85] As a young boy, Bruce
                Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his
                wife Martha, murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun
                on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to
                its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the
                origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and
                hence, canonized, events have been few in number",[85] a situation altered by an increased effort by
                later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.[125]

                In Batman's first appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.[126]
                Batman's origin is first presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in
                Batman #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very
                wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites. Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and
                privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe
                Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his
                life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that
                these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so
                my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black,
                terrible ..." As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce
                to craft the Batman persona.[127]
            </p>
            <p>
                In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period,
                Bruce Wayne has a fiancé named Julie Madison.[128] In Detective Comics #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned
                circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who becomes his vigilante partner, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding
                member of the Justice Society of America,[129] although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,[130]
                and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is
                made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department.[131] During this time, Alfred Pennyworth
                arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as
                their butler.[132]

            <div class="subTitle">
                <span class="subTitle_text">Silver Age</span>
            </div>
            <p>
                The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher
                introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash. Batman is not significantly changed by
                the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman
                had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and
                early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in
                the manner of other characters until Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his
                detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the introduction of DC Comics' Multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the
                Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners
                with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman (Selina Kyle). The two have a daughter, Helena Wayne,
                who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the
                Earth-Two Robin, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of
                police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles, however,
                often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since
                unlike the Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the
                1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.[133] Nevertheless, details
                of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a
                future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208
                (February 1969)) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical
                versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.[134][135] In 1980, then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the
                Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he
                began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and
                continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close
                friends. As a founding member of the Justice League of America, Batman appears in its first story, in
                1960's The Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, The Brave and the Bold became a Batman title,
                in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.

            <p>
                After the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major
                characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's
                origin in the storyline "Year One" from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the
                character.[138] Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver
                Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the Post-Crisis
                universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's
                police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is
                removed, leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a
                founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new
                incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following
                Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published
                various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period.

                Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of
                the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the
                new Robin.[139]

                Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a
                number of issues. In 1993, DC published "Knightfall". During the storyline's first phase, the new
                villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of
                "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and
                Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael
                becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to
                Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.[140]

                The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! changes aspects of DC continuity
                again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the
                criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.

                Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the
                series, titled JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover
                arc. In 1998's "Cataclysm" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off
                from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the
                city from legions of gangs during 1999's "No Man's Land".

                Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the
                events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement
                allies Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down",
                while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his
                to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang
                war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. Lex Luthor
                arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd (introduced in the
                mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "Bruce Wayne: Fugitive" story arcs. Though Batman is
                able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited
                into the organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's
                evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper,
                Batman does get his revenge with help from Talia al Ghul in Superman/Batman #1–6.
